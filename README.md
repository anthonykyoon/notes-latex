# Notes from Uchicago

These are my notes that I typed up from my time at the University of Chicago. These include 

- MATH 19620 Linear Algebra 
- DATA 13600 Introduction to Data Engineering
- STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra
- STAT 24310 Numerical Linear Algebra, Introduction to Computation.
- ECON 20210 Honors Elements of Economic Analysis III

These will have a lot of typos, so be advised. You can also see how my style of notes have evolved overtime. 

Any unlabled PSET at the current moment is most likely ECON 20210 PSETs

My current LaTeX template is `hw_template.tex`
