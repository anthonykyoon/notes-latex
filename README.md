# Notes from Uchicago

These are my notes that I typed up from my time at the University of Chicago. These include 

- MATH 19620 Linear Algebra 
- DATA 13600 Introduction to Data Engineering
- STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra
- ECON 20210 Elements of Economic Analysis III

These will have a lot of typos, so be advised. You can also see how my style of notes have evolved overtime.
