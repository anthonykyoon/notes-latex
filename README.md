# Notes from Uchicago

These are my notes that I typed up from my time at the University of Chicago. These include 

- MATH 19620 Linear Algebra 
- DATA 13600 Introduction to Data Engineering
- STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra
- STAT 24310 Numerical Linear Algebra, Introduction to Computation. (WIP)
- ECON 20210 Honors Elements of Economic Analysis III (WIP)

These will have a lot of typos, so be advised. You can also see how my style of notes have evolved overtime. 

Any unlabled PSET at the current moment is most likely ECON 20210 PSETs. Probably will label those who are different. 

My current LaTeX template is `hw_template.tex`. `latex_aux_clear.py` is a python script I use to clean all auxilary files created by LaTeX compilation.

# Previous Years PSETS
If you want to see my PSETs for any purpose, feel free to contact me. Throughout the school year, I keep my problem sets here as a means for storage, but will take them down as soon as the quarter is over.
