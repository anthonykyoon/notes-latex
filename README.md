# Notes from Uchicago

These are my notes that I typed up from my time at the University of Chicago. These include 

- MATH 19620 Linear Algebra 
- DATA 13600 Introduction to Data Engineering
- STAT 24300 Numerical Linear Algebra
- STAT 24310 Numerical Linear Algebra, Introduction to Computation. (WIP)

These will have a lot of typos, so be advised. You can also see how my style of notes have evolved overtime. 


My current LaTeX template is `hw_template.tex`. `latex_aux_clear.py` is a python script I use to clean all auxilary files created by LaTeX compilation.

# Previous Years PSETS
If you want to see my PSETs for any purpose, feel free to contact me and we can discuss. Throughout the school year, I try to keep my problem sets here as a means for storage, but will take them down as soon as the quarter is over.
